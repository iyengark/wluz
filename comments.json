Let us move on to day two. This process is reversed and those who cooked yesterday are fed today and charged the same $1 per dinner. The growth will be another $160 million. In other words the economy grew $320 million over two days. What if instead of exchanging dinners, each one had cooked and eaten their own dinner. The economic impact would have been zero. That's right, zero! And the difference between the two scenarios - also zero!<br/><br/>Obviously this is an extremely simple example and there are more nuances that I'm skipping over, but the point is that valuation of goods and services, let alone intellectual property, is very hard and is subject to many assumptions.

In the name of stability and economic growth, America, just like in the post WWII era, supports regimes that are anything but democratic. Why have the Indo-US and Brazil-US relationships not blossomed like that of Sino-US? Because Brazil and India are pluralistic democratic societies that have their own internal issues and tend to be politically more volatile than China where one party controls the government and markets.<br/><br/>Although it would be harder, it would be better for America to develop stronger ties with Brazil and India in the next decade or two.

And this is where schools can help. If you look back at recycling, it was kids who learnt to recycle from school that provided one source of information and pressure on families to recycle. Likewise, cooking should become a course offered in high school. Who knows, in due time these kids will grow up with the requisite skills to cook themselves.<br/><br/>Cooking is not just putting together materials and other stuff. While that is where the beginner may start, it is really understanding and getting an appreciation for how materials and stuff work together. And that used to be inculcated in families. Maybe it is schools that have to become the venue where such skills are taught.<br/><br/>And, I often hear the lament about lack of time. That is, for the most part, an excuse. People have the time to watch TV; why not combine watching with cooking? And, cooking is quite therapeutic, especially if done with family members. Ask your 10-year old son/daughter to chop onions as you rinse the broccoli while the 12-year old can be adding water to the rice and getting that started. Believe me, that is what we do in our family. And both of us (dad and mom) work. We have a healthy dinner that invariably includes a salad in under 30 minutes.", "commentTitle": "n/a"}

This column touches upon each one but glosses over them. <br/><br/>First, using social norms works best when it is timed perfectly. So, if we wanted to reduce drinking on campus, we need to reach students on Thursday/Friday evenings just when they are about to embark on this behavior. All the publicity prior to that will have some effect, but arguably much less. This, as one can see, poses some problems, and maybe one of the reasons for its limited use. <br/><br/>Second, using social norms works best when the evidence is \"highly credible and accurate.\" Credibility is in the minds of the viewer. What is credible to me may not be credible to someone else. If I believe that most southerners are gun owners and closet racists, any amount of evidence may not be seen as credible by me. Presenting evidence that is seen as credible is another impediment in applying these principles in more contexts.<br/><br/>Third, there is the boomerang effect, whose effects are under-recognized here. As the author points, other than in Lake Wobegon, generally, and not surprisingly, one half of people are above average and one half are below average and so using social norms will tell one half the people that they are behaving better than the social norm. <br/><br/>Whereas using social norms is a powerful idea, there are many reasons for its limited use.", "commentTitle": "n/a"}

Healthcare - we all have access to the emergency room. Education - those lucky teachers have a cushy 3 month summer holiday, why bother paying them well or trying to attract good people. Space - we will have a colony and the 51st state in the next eight years, but for now we need to cut NASA's budget. I could go on and on and on.

In the case of pot, the user is targeted and put in jail instead of the pusher. This is akin to the prostitute getting arrested for selling her services instead of her pimp. But, as you rightly point out, the reality is very complicated - some prostitutes willingly enter into this trade whereas others are conscripted. And even those who are forced into this trade, like Taz, sometimes develop a bond with their pimp, much like hostages who develop an affinity for their captors. The situation is made even more complex when prostitutes, who when they get caught by the police, do not trust the police. There are two very important changes that are needed. First, we need institutions that can harbor these women and guide them back into regular society far from the clutches of the police and the harsh gaze of society. Second, we need to target men who solicit prostitutes and shame them publicly, maybe by putting their names on a publicly available list much like those of sex offenders and pedophiles. It is time that men took some more responsibility instead of simply being bystanders in this heinous crime that they are mainly responsible for.

Bravo! Good luck on implementing some of the suggested changes though. If I sound pessimistic, it is because I have studies some of these issues and understand the difficulties involved in bringing about the requisite attitudinal and behavioral changes. Take for instance the idea of changing over to a plant based diet. Give up beef? Beef is about as sacred to the American diet as cow is to the Indian! Take the idea of home cooking for another. The average American lacks the time, knowledge and interest needed to cook at home. Recently I was at a party when a 30-year old married woman told that she would not know what to do with a bunch of broccoli. And yet she must have eaten it many times at a restaurant. She lacked the knowledge, for sure, but more importantly, she did not show any interest in correcting that situation. Next, take the idea of reducing waste. It is fashionable to over-order and waste rather than under-order and feel slightly less than fully satiated. Every time I have eaten at a restaurant, I am amazed at the cavalier manner in which kids order at a table near us. Adults accompanying them do not intervene and suggest that they limit their ordering and not waste food. Invariably the kids plate(s) goes (go) back less than half eaten. Lastly, take the idea of recycling. This is one of the hardest behaviors to instill. Yet, this is the only one I am most optimistic about. This generation of kids has been exposed to recycling from a young age, and thus I believe they will recycle more readily when they become adults.<br />So, the bottom line is that we need a major overhaul in the American attitude and values, and these are the hardest to change.", "commentTitle": null}

But then again, with the Glenn Becks and Sarah Palins and Michelle Bachmans of the world pandering lies shamelessly, the simple reality gets hidden, obfuscated, and completely lost.

Kirkpatrick was endlessly arguing that Gates and Zuckerberg were visionaries because they persisted with their idea and saw it come to fruition. But as Wright points out, there must have been hundreds of people who had the same or similar ideas and who persisted just like Gates and Zuckerberg, yet failed because they were not helped by positive externalities.  We always hear success stories and so naturally assume that perseverance paid off. If instead, we dug deeper into the failed efforts, we'd see that negative externalities was what did them in. I don't want to suggest that gates and Zuckerberg are useless idiots, far from it, but I do want to shift more of the credit to positive externalities. This whole idea of a genius who comes out of the blue and saves the world is a relic from the distant past religious scriptures. Moses saved the Jews, Rama saved Sita, Krishna saved the world, Jesus continues to save us from ourselves and on and on and on. Not that these people were not great, but it just ain't so simple, it takes more than one person and lots of positive externalities (you could also call it dumb luck, but that wouldn't be fair either) to make somebody or something successful.<br />", "commentTitle": null}

Now, you will suddely see more players move to doubles. Not only that, they will try to forge more permanent partnerships, like the Bryan brothers have done, who other than that they are brothers may not have been as regularly partnering each other. And, CBS will devote more TV time. And more fans will flock to thos courts. So, my friends, it is all in the amount of money.
